a)
A faster CPU may decrease the CPU utilization percentage. 20% CPU utilization means that the CPU idles 80% of the time. If it does things even faster, the idle time could be longer such that the utilization percentage may become lower.

b)
A faster paging disk could increase the CPU utilization. Since CPU spends less time waiting on the paging disk I/O, it can do more things, becoming more busy. In that case, the CPU utilization percentage will increase.

c)
Increasing the degree of multiprogramming could have almost no effect on CPU utilization, or even a bit worse. When context switching, the paging disk access could result in CPU waiting. In that case, CPU utilization could be slightly decreased.
